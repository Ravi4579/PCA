# PCA and Clustering Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and clustering techniques to analyze a dataset. The analysis involves comparing clustering results on the original dataset and PCA-transformed data to understand the impact of dimensionality reduction on clustering performance.

## Tasks Completed

### Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. **Dataset Loading and Exploration:**
   - Loaded the dataset and performed basic exploration to understand its structure and contents (e.g., feature types, missing values, etc.).
   
2. **Feature Distribution Analysis:**
   - Used histograms, box plots, and density plots to examine the distribution of features.

3. **Correlation Investigation:**
   - Computed and visualized correlations between features to identify relationships and potential redundancies in the data.

---

### Task 2: Dimensionality Reduction with PCA
1. **Feature Standardization:**
   - Standardized features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 to ensure uniformity.

2. **PCA Implementation:**
   - Applied PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset.

3. **Optimal Principal Components:**
   - Determined the optimal number of components using techniques such as the scree plot and cumulative explained variance analysis.

4. **Dataset Transformation:**
   - Transformed the original dataset into its principal components.

---

### Task 3: Clustering with Original Data
1. **Clustering Algorithm:**
   - Applied K-means clustering to the original dataset.

2. **Visualization:**
   - Visualized clustering results using scatter plots and pair plots.

3. **Evaluation:**
   - Assessed clustering performance using metrics like silhouette score and Daviesâ€“Bouldin index.

### Task 4: Clustering with PCA Data
1. **Clustering on PCA Data:**
   - Reapplied K-means clustering to the PCA-transformed dataset.

2. **Visualization:**
   - Visualized clustering results obtained from the PCA-transformed data.

3. **Comparison:**
   - Compared clustering results from PCA-transformed data with those from the original dataset.

---

### Task 5: Comparison and Analysis
1. **Comparison of Results:**
   - Compared clustering outcomes for original and PCA-transformed datasets, analyzing similarities and differences in cluster distributions.

2. **Impact of PCA:**
   - Evaluated the impact of dimensionality reduction on clustering performance in terms of metrics and visual separability.

3. **Trade-offs:**
   - Discussed the trade-offs between applying clustering directly on the original dataset versus PCA-transformed data.

---

### Task 6: Conclusion and Insights
1. **Key Findings:**
   - Summarized key findings, including the impact of PCA on dimensionality reduction and clustering.

2. **Practical Implications:**
   - Highlighted the practical use cases of PCA and clustering techniques in data analysis workflows.

3. **Recommendations:**
   - Provided recommendations on when to use PCA for dimensionality reduction and how to approach clustering tasks effectively.
